## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a five day weather forcast using boostrap, Jquery and a Weather API. In this app, you are able to search for any city in the Weather API's database and you will be provided with a five day forecast for that exact location. The forecast consists of the temperature, wind and humidity of each given day, including the present. Your search history is also saved to local storage where you can click recent searches to view that exact city again.
